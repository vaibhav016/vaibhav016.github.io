									<h2>Image Super Resolution (Jan 2021)</h2>
									<p> Converting low resolution (128x128) to high resolution(512x512) image using Generative Adversarial Networks. The inspiration for this project was the inability to find a high resolution video for my favourite song - “The Diary of Jane” by Breaking Benjamin. 
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>The idea of using GAN was very interesting. The working of GANs can be explained by the most widely used analogy -“making the model smarter at recognising fake images from real ones”. This is done by using two parallel neural networks. One will classify images into real and fake(Discriminator) and the other will generate new images. Now the natural question arises-”How can this system of one model classifying and the other generating images, give a model which can generate synthetic images as close to real ones?” The answer lies in our Loss function. 
									<br></br>
									The loss function of the discriminator is intuitive to understand. Since it's a classifier, it will be trained to distinguish between images which have labels as Real, and those which are generated by Generator(Fake). A simple binary classification task at its play! 
									<br></br>
									For the Generator, we want its output to be as close to the real image, so we will make its labels as Real and then compute the loss function over the Discriminator’s output probability for the synthesised images. Training these two models together for sufficiently large training steps eventually produces a generator that is capable of synthesising images which look as Real images. 
									<br></br>
									Now translating this idea to our super resolution problem statement, our real images are the super resolution images, and the low resolution images when extrapolated to the high res size, become the input to the Generator. The output of a trained model would then give us high resolution images. 
									<br></br>
									This idea is similar to the encoder decoder model. Both these ideas use the concept of Learning Representation from Latent Spaces. I wanted to experiment more on these ideas, but unfortunately due to limited time, I could only implement the GAN version in Pytorch. 
									<br></br>

									<h2>Voice Style Transfer (Jan 2021)</h2>
									<p>Again inspired by the idea of Latent Spaces and GAN, I implemented a very interesting use-case. Extracting the timbre of my voice and superimposing it on other’s voices. </p>
								</header>
								<p>
									This idea is also borrowed from the computer vision’s idea of image style transfer. The fundamental concept is that our speech can be categorised into 2 sets of features- Content level(the actual phoneme or simply the content that one speaks) and Style level(the timbre or the texture of the speaker voice). If we employ two convolutional encoder models, one being a deep encoder for the content and the other being a shallow encoder for style, then the output of our model, should have minimum content loss with respect to the original input and minimum style loss with respect to the other person’s style(which we want our output to sound like).

									<h2>Audio Classification (Feb-2021)</h2>
									<p>These projects involve two major projects
										<ol>
											<li>
												Emotion classification from speech
											</li>

											<li>
												Guitar chords classification
											</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>Both work on similar lines. Firstly, feature extraction is made from speech. For these projects, traditional feature extraction is made using MFCC. Then those features are fed to the deep convolution classification network which can learn the spectral as well as the temporal features from audio. 
									<br></br> 
									The emotion classification used emo-db dataset, which is highly curated and made for academic research. But for guitar chord classification, I had to synthesize a huge dataset for guitar chords. Since they were undergraduate projects, these projects made the foundation for machine learning and deep learning.
